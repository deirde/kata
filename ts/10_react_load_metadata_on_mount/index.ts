/*
Exercise 1
Part 1
Write a react component which will call a loadMetadata function when the component is mounted.

It will take 3 props:

1. LoadMetaData - A function
2. Title - A String
3. Ratings - An Integer
The component should output a title and a rating from the passed in props

Part 2
There is an additional test that needs to be implemented where we should re - call loadMetadata when the title prop changes

Part 3
The component can also take an Image prop.Update the component to render the Image and write an additional test to cover this functionality change.

    Question:
How could we make sure that our React component is accessible for the end user ?
